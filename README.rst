Tutorial CSS Paged Media
========================

This tutorial shows how to generate PDF documents from XML/HTML
using the "CSS Paged Media" approach where the complete styling
and layout information is keep in cascading stylessheets (CSS).


What is CSS Paged Media
-----------------------

Short version: CSS Paged Media (a W3C standard) is a way to generate
PDF documents from XML/HTML as input and CSS for styling. Consider it as
an extension for CSS for print purposes. So it is obvious that CSS Paged Media
must deal with print aspects like pagination, page formats, page regions or 
other print specific aspects.

Status of this tutorial
-----------------------

This tutorial is work-in-progress and based on the "CSS Paged Media"
workshop given for the first time at the XML London 2015 conference.
The tutorial is split into various aspects of CSS Paged Media and usually
contains a sample `Ã¬ndex.html`` with example data suitable for the purpose
of a particiular lesson and a ``styles.css`` file holding the specific
print styles. The styles are kept as simple as impossible in order to demonstrate
the functionality. Nice layout options are being omitted for the sake keeping
everything as simple as possible.

Software
--------

The tutorial is based on external converters like 

* PDFreactor 7 (www.pdfreactor.com)

or

* PrinceXML 10 (www.princexml.com)

The external converters are available for all decent operating systems like
MacOS, Windows or Linux. The preferred converter for this tool is PDFreactor.
Both converters are available for evaluation or private purposes for free.
Antennahouse provides a special "CSS Edition" of its Antennahouse Formatter
software as well - however we do not have much experience with this version (in
addition to the much higher license fees).
